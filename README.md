# OpenAI Examples

Some OpenAI examples that you can play around with.

First of all, you need to create an OpenAI account and a generate a new API token. Store the token in a `.env` file like this:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-OwPTvKFJsjYMLLClqeituHN46UQVExrmT3BlbkasLqLGVUXw
```

There are a set of Jupyter notebooks you can use to play around with the APIs.
